This repository is designed to be a template to ‘dockerise’ coding repositories.
When working collaboratively on a project, participants often have different operating systems and setups.
This can be a real nightmare, especially when testing if your code behaves as intended.
To bypass this, it is useful for all participants to be able to set up the same virtual environment with exactly the same settings,
within which the project can be compiled, run, and tested.
Docker presents itself as a universal, easily accessible solution, with a minimal setup effort.
